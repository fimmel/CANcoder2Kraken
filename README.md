# CANcoder 2 Kraken

This is a small board that allows the CANcoder to havve a Molex SL connectoir attached. This simple board eleiminates the need to solder wires onto the CANcoder. It also follows the same pinout as the PowerPole adaptor board on the Kraken motors.

## Tools & Supplies needed

- [CANcoder](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/products/cancoder)
- Soldering Iron (With a small tip)
- Solder
- [Flush Cutters](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/american-hakko-products-inc/CHP-170/6228793)
- Helping hands (Not required, but helps)
- [Molex SL Crimper](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0638118700/1832243) (Usually an option in FIRST Choice)
- [Molex 0016020102 Crimp Connectors](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0016020102/115053)

## Assembly

### Gather Parts
Your kit will include everything below except the CANcoder itself. You will also need the stuff listed above.

### Cut Pin Headers Apart
Take you stip of pin headers and use the flush cutters to cut 2 singles and 2 doubles.

> [!TIP]
> Cut them into your hand as they will go flying. We have incuded a few spare pins just in case.

### Insert Headers into boards
Place your CANcoder into the helping hands with the magnet sensor down (wire lables up) and inser the pins. The 2 sets of 2 will be for CAN high and CAN low.

### Place PCB
Make sure the outline of the connector is on the top and place the PCB on the pins.

### Solder 1 pin on both sides
Using your soldering iron, solder the same pin on both sides. 

> [!TIP]
> After soldering one side, let it cool, then carefully flip it over like you are flipping a grilled cheese and you don't want the cheese to fall out. Then solder the other side.

### Check Alignment
We want the board to be level or angle slightly down.

**Bad Alignment**

**Good Alignment**

> [!WARNING]
> Bad alignment will cause the cable to have an upward angle and may cause the sensor to move away from the magnet.

To adjust the alignment heat up the one soldered pin and adjust the board.

### Solder Remaining Pins
Solder the remaining pins on both sides avoiding the pin already soldered.

### Trim Height
Cut off the excess height of the pins on the top side with your flush cutters.
> [!WARNING]
> Be sure to wear safety glasses!

### Insert Connector
Insert the Molex connector into the PCB, it will snap in place and make take some force. Be careful ont to put stress on the solder joints we just make or bend any pins on the connector.

### Solder Pins
Solder the pins on the connector.

### Trim Case
Trim the case to fit over the PCB

** Cut 1 **

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be gentle and make sure not to crack the rest of the case. if you do end up cracking it. replacements can be ordered from CTRE.

### Assemble
Attach the bottom ofthe case to your robot where you normally would. insert the PCB assembly adnd affix the cover!

### Make Cable
Make the 4pin molex cable. Instructions and tips coming!
